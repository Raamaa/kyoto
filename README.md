This is the master branch for the kyoto repo
=====

This is the master branch. This will be the final working simulation. So groups need to be working on their separate branches.

You can branch into your groups according to your group number such as:

1) Group1: gp1

and so on.

This README will be updated later on with proper instructions to make it look amazing with proper wiki page setup.

We are gonna go big guys!!!!!
